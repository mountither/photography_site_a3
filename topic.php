        <h2>Say cheese</h2>
        <p>Let's talk photography and take a look at the progression the industry has
          experienced. We will disect this massively broad subject. We will work our 
          way from the definition of photography to the camera industry's presence.</p><br/>
      </div>
  
      <div id="basics">
        <h2>Back to Basics, Photography</h2>
        <p>Let's look at word, it is a Greek word for light, not in the sense of heavy or light but set 
            light in the sense of the Sun like what you see with your eye and then you've got ‘graphy’ and 
            ‘graphy’ sort of means something along the lines of drawing so when you put those two things 
            together you come up with drawing with light which I think is a really great way of describing
            what photography is. Photography really is in a lot of ways drawing with light, now what would 
            be a more functional working definition of photography so to answer that I took a really quick 
            look in Google and I came across a definition in the world English dictionary so has two pieces 
            the first piece is the process of recording image on <a class="ui-tooltip" title="A chemical process used in early photography"><span style="cursor: help;"><mark>Sensitised material</mark></span></a>  by the action of light 
            x-rays and it also is the chemical processing of a material to produce a print a slide or a film,
            So basically they're just saying light plus film equals photo or photography. 
        </p>
        <div class="types_photo">
            <p>It is important to understand the difference between different types of photographers, 
            so we're going to just start out by organise them all out so you’ll have a broad idea </p>

        <h2>The Antiquity</h2>
        <p>The idea for a pinhole camera came up it came up with in the time of Plato in ancient Greece and in China around the same time people were kind of imagining doing sort of sort of thought 
            experiments for something that would someday resemble what would use hundreds of years later thousand years later in the pinhole camera now the next step is the camera <a class="ui-tooltip" title="Latin, meaning 'Dark Room'"><span style="cursor: help;"><mark>obscura</mark></span></a> and the camera obscura is interesting because it's basically a camera without 
            film the idea is you've got a wall, so you've got this empty room and if you put a little tiny hole in the wall the light will come in from the other side and it will be sort of focus through 
            that hole and then onto the wall on the opposite side. <cite>Gernsheim, Helmut (1986). A concise history of photography. Courier Dover Publications. ISBN 0-486-25128-4.</cite>

      <div id="evolution">
          <h2>The Evolution</h2>
          <p>We use cameras every day be it to check our teeth for food take an RT photo or share a snapshot 
            of what you're doing with all of your friends as a whole mankind is taken around three point eight 
            trillion photos ever 10 percent of which were taken in the past twelve months but have you ever 
            considered how the camera came about in the first place it begins with the human desire to capture 
            reality drawing and painting were initially developed as a way to imitate and represent certain 
            aspects of our surroundings to assist in capturing this reality. let's go back to the Burgundy of France 
            the Year 1826 Joseph Nicéphore a French inventor had been experimenting with light sensitive materials for 
            quite some time he was incapable as an artist. So he used his knowledge of chemistry to develop a human 
            solution but he coated on a <a class="ui-tooltip" title="A mallable metal alloy, utilised majorly during the Middle Ages"><span style="cursor: help;"><mark>pewter plate</mark></span></a>  and exposed to eight hours of sunlight capturing the first photograph
             known to mankind after his death in 1833. His understudy Louis Daguerre took this idea and geared it towards 
             public use in the form of a <a class="ui-tooltip" title="The daguerreotype was the first commercially successful photographic process"><span style="cursor: help;"><mark>daguerreotype</mark></span></a> 
             this invention became vastly popular but as with any piece
              of technology it had its issues per one during capture each person would have to sit completely still for many 
              minutes hence why people in these photographs tend to look unhappy it was difficult to hold a grin for the duration 
              of the exposure so many opted for a neutral face that sometimes came off as angry. With the Garrow types retaking an image 
            really wasn't an option so in the year 1900 kodak released this the Kodak Brownie the brownie was the introduction to everyday 
            photography as we know it today as you can see this is basically a miniature version of the camera obscura with a hole cut out here 
            that has a lens put in it rather than a pinhole this allows a more concentrated amount of light to flow into the camera thus allowing 
            a shorter exposure time through the view finder on the side you are able 
            to see what you are taking an image of though it is upside down as it was with 
            the camera obscura in order to capture the image light-sensitive film would be placed here the consumers of this product would never develop 
            the images themselves hence the tagline you press the button we do the rest over the years cameras have drastically transformed 
            from box to film Polaroid DSLR GoPro and even smartphones so next time that you 
            take a picture consider how much history went into capturing that one moment

        <div id="the_state">
          <h2>The State of the Camera industry</h2>
          <p>The video smartphones are killing the 
              non interchangeable lens market or the 
              compact camera market fewer DSLRs are 
              being made fewer mirrorless are being 
              sold and potentially anticipated. In 2016 there was a 35% of drop in camera bodies 
              shipped over 2015 and there was additionally, a 16 percent drop in lenses 
              that were shipped in 2016 as opposed to 2015. In 2016 there was a 17% drop in the 
              DSLR cameras that were produced and a 4 
              percent drop. There used to be a huge demand for compact cameras and 
              there is no longer the DSLR market. The interchangeable lens camera market 
              hasn't really kept pace with the exceptional fall of compact cameras 
              because smartphones have done such a great job of putting a camera into 
              everybody's pockets. <br/> So what does this mean... there will be less 
              because there is so many fewer sales of what used to be the largest category in 
              the compact cameras and because DSLR and mirrorless sales and lens sales are all 
              going down there will be a reduction in revenue to expand through research and development 
              and so there will be less innovation in the imaging field because as I've been saying smartphones are taken over a lot of those dollars we can safely assume that in foreseeable future 
              the market for interchangeable lens cameras will drop below 20 million units 
              sold which is approximately one-sixth of that which was sold in 2010 what that 
              means is that there will be more emphasis on higher-end gear because 
              professionals will still need gear and really high quality gear resultantly 
              more gear will cost more money and new gear will cost more money than 
              previously. (refer to figure 01)
